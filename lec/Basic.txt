- Want to create a table "Book"
- Make sure the author of the book exists in the table "Author"

CREATE TABLE Book( 
	bookid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
	title TEXT, authorid INTEGER, 
	FOREIGN KEY (authorid) REFERENCES 
	Author(authorid));

Primary key- can only have one in a table (e.g. user ID)
